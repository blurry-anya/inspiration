## Just stuff for fun (meaning practicing vanilla JavaScript)

This small project consists of three features so far:
 - bouncing balls: limit 25 balls, click on the empty place will create a new ball, starting amount of the balls is 10;
 - coloring game: the cells amount and size can differ basing on the window's width and height;
 - picture game: the cells amount and size can differ basing on the window's width and height, there is no validation in the input field.

I created these features ages ago, but they are kinda cute, so I decided to at least put them together as a confirmation of the place I've started from.

And it's not responsive, don't judge me xD It was created just for the sake of practicing.

I may update this project if I find some other old scripts :)
