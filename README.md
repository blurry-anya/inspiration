## Just stuff for fun (meaning practicing vanilla JavaScript)

This small project consists of three features so far:
 - bouncing balls;
 - coloring game;
 - picture game.

I created these features ages ago, but they are kinda cute, so I decided to at least put them together as a confirmation of the place I've started from.
Please note that there is no validation in the input field for the picture game, so please mind the links you're entering there.

I may update this project if I find some other old scripts :)
